This version uses a more efficient implementation with orb for early termination.

It takes three parameters:
- n: The size of the board (N×N)
- k: The number of queens left to place
- partial: The current partial solution

Returns a list of all valid solutions that can be built from the partial solution.
This function:
1. Uses safeb_efficient to check potential queen placements
2. Recursively builds solutions by trying each valid column position
3. Uses flat_map to combine all valid solutions
